I like building structures and I like user-friendly, beautiful interfaces. 
My goal is to create usable and interesting web applications, so that cool projects get the attention of users.

I'm currently learning React.js and UX/UI.
My experience includes developing CRM systems, Telegram bots, online shops and landing page websites.
Revenge is a hobby. I teach programming to teenagers and motivate them to learn.
